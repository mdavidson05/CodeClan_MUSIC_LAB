## Music Collection

You have been asked to create an app that will allow a music collector to manage their collection of CDs/records.

In their console they would like to be able to:

* Create and Save Artists
* Create and Save Albums
* Delete all Artists / Albums
* Find Artists/Albums by their ID (`select`)
* List All Artists/Albums (`select_all`)


Every artist should have a name, and each album should have a name/title, genre and artist.

## Further tasks

Additionally it would be nice to be able to:

* List all the albums by an artist
* Edit Artists/Albums
* Delete Artists/Albums

Remember to regularly git commit!

## Tips and Tricks!!! 

Remeber you need to create your database first! Your database should be called `music_shop` 

Remeber you will need to have your `run_sql()` function to use this particular database. 

We don't need any front end functionailty here just the repoistory functions to be working correctly and the tables in the database to be properply formatted. 

Use your `console.py` file to test using either print statements or pdb or feel free to use Postico to test as well.
